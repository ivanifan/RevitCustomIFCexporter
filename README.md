# RevitCustomIFCexporter
The goal of this project is to modify the custom revit IFC exporter so that it exports data needed for energy simulation by OpenStudio.
This project is funded by CBEI task 3.1 BIM data hub. 
I got the sourcecode from https://sourceforge.net/projects/ifcexporter/ in Nov. 2015
