how to setup wix install

1. re-add the three projects in reference. The reference to Revit.IFC.common is wrong
2. edit the product.wxs file. Go down to the ComponentGroup where .dlls from projects are listed.
	a.change the source to the file path where your project builds the dlls
	b. comment out all the .sig components
	c. there is another .dll that is not built by projects but come with the source code, that one is in $(dir of IFCExportUIOverride.dll)\fr\
3. edit the buildInstaller.bat
	a. change the WixRoot to where you install your wixtool, add quote to wixroot if you have space in file/folder name
	b. add %WixRoot%\before the candle.exe and light.exe. Here is a sample bat file.
-----sample bat file --
echo Build IFC installer

echo %1
echo %2
echo yifan says I know it is not easy. 

set ThisBatFileRoot=%~dp0
rem Set this path to your Wix bin directory.
set WixRoot= "C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.10\bin"

rem It is necessary to add the Wix bin directory to the system path temporarily to use the -ext flag below.
SET PATH=%PATH%;%WixRoot%

%WixRoot%\candle.exe -dProjectDir=%2 -ext WixUtilExtension %2Product.wxs 
%WixRoot%\light.exe -ext WixUtilExtension -out RevitIFC2016.msi product.wixobj -ext WixUIExtension

copy RevitIFC2016.msi %1..\Releasex64
del RevitIFC2016.msi

echo %1..\Releasex64\RevitIFC2016.msi
